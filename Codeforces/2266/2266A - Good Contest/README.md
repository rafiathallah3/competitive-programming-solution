## Problem Statement

The next programming contest has three problems and $n$$n$ participants.

Problem $1$$1$ is easy, problem $2$$2$ is medium, and problem $3$$3$ is hard.

A participant is called *weak* if they did not solve all three problems.

Unfortunately, the scoreboard was lost. The only remaining information is an array $a$$a$ of length $3$$3$, where $ai$$a_i$ is the number of participants who solved problem $i$$i$.

Among all scoreboards consistent with this information, find the minimum possible number of weak participants.

### Input

The first line contains an integer $t$$t$ ($1≤t≤3000$$1 \le t \le 3000$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$$n$ ($1≤n≤9$$1 \le n \le 9$) — the number of participants.

The second line of each test case contains three integers $a1,a2,a3$$a_1, a_2, a_3$ ($0≤ai≤n$$0 \le a_i \le n$), where $ai$$a_i$ is the number of participants who solved problem $i$$i$.

### Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible number of weak participants.

## Example

**Input**
```text
6
3
3 3 3
4
4 4 3
1
1 1 1
9
9 8 9
5
0 5 5
6
4 3 2
```

**Output**
```text
0
1
0
1
5
4
```


## Note

In the first test case, all $3$$3$ participants can have solved all three problems, so the answer is $0$$0$.

In the second test case, participant $1$$1$ could have solved only problems $1$$1$ and $2$$2$, while participants $2$$2$, $3$$3$, and $4$$4$ solved all three problems. Therefore, participant $1$$1$ is the only participant who is weak, so the answer is $1$$1$. It can be shown that this is minimal.
